# My First Project

This is my first project as a full-stack engineer. I am learning how to use Git and GitHub to manage my code and collaborate with other developers. In this project, I created a new repository called zero_day and added a README.md file to it. This file contains a brief description of my project.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the zero_day directory.
3. Open the README.md file and read the contents.
4. Enjoy!
